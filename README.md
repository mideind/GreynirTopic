## Text similarity and topic indexing for Icelandic

This repository contains the basic scaffolding of
a text similarity and topic indexing engine for Icelandic.
It is created by extracting the topic vector functionality
from [Greynir](https://github.com/mideind/Greynir) and
packaging it in a separate Python package for general use.

GreynirTopic is installable via `pip`, for example using
`pip install -e .` for an editable install.

A usage example can be found in `test/test_model.py`.

Copyright (C) 2020 Mi√∞eind ehf. GreynirTopic is licensed under the MIT license.

The code is under active development. Contributions are welcome.
